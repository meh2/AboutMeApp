		<h1>College &amp; Career</h1>
	</div>
	<div data-role="content">
	 <p>When I graduated from high school, I began as a business major at Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. I soon realized that I didn't want to have a career in business.</p>
      
     <p>I took some time off and soon fell in love with web design. I knew right away that it was something that I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I am currently a senior at the Pennsylvania College of Technology in Web and Interactive Media.</p>
     
     <p>I love the web, coding, designing, troubleshooting and creating something out of nothing. I get very excited to practice and learn about all of the new and changing technologies of the web.</p>
     
     <p>I have skills and experience with HTML, CSS, PHP, MySQL, graphic design, WordPress and other content management systems, responsive design, InDesign, Photoshop, digital photograpghy, Dreamweaver, Javascript and jQUERY.</p>
     
     <p>Until I graduate, I am working at the Penn College Madigan Library as a Library and Technical Assistant. I can't wait to start my career in web design and development.</p>

	  <p>Above everything else, I am a mother to my three-year-old daughter, Maylene. Being a mommy is, by far, my favorite thing about life.</p> <p>Also, in my humble opinion, I think that it should be completely legitimate to add things like, "potty-training" and "taking a toddler with the 'terrible-twos' to the grocery store" to my resume. In comparison, learning coding languages is far easier than raising a little one. But I wouldn't have it any other way. I've been teaching her some HTML and she's coming along.</p>

	  <p>In the off chance that I do get some free time, I love to spend it with my family. With 5 siblings, there is never a dull moment.</p> <p>I enjoy biking, baking, decorating cakes, painting, drinking coffee, going to the beach, art, running, reading, journaling, photography, hiking and being in the outdoors.</p>
